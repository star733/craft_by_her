6. **Agent delivers** → Order status: `delivered`, `deliveryStatus.delivered: true`

### Email Notifications
- **Admin notifications**: When delivery agent accepts/rejects orders
- **Seller notifications**: When orders are picked up with detailed information
- **Email templates**: Professional HTML emails with order and agent details
