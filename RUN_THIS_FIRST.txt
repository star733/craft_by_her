🔧 IMPORTANT: FIX NOTIFICATION ISSUE
=====================================

STEP 1: Run the Diagnostic Script
----------------------------------
This script will fix the sellerId issue AND create a test notification with a real order:

Command:
  node server/test-notification.js

This script will:
✅ Find the "Red Velvet" product
✅ Find Micah's user account
✅ Check if the product's sellerId matches Micah's UID
✅ Update the product if needed
✅ Find an existing order with Red Velvet product
✅ Create a test notification linked to that order

STEP 2: Restart the Server
---------------------------
After running the script, restart your server:

1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again: node server/index.js

STEP 3: Test the Notification System
-------------------------------------
1. Login as Micah (the seller)
2. Go to seller dashboard (http://localhost:5173/seller)
3. Click the notification bell icon (top-right)
4. You should see the test notification with order details
5. Click "View Order & Move to Hub" button
6. You'll be taken to the order details page showing:
   - Order information (number, date, status, payment)
   - Product details (images, variants, quantities, prices)
   - Buyer information (name, email, phone, address)
   - "Move to Hub" button
7. Click "Move to Hub" button
8. Select your nearest hub from the modal
9. Click "Confirm" to move products to hub

STEP 4: What Happens Next
--------------------------
After moving to hub:
✅ Order status changes to "at_seller_hub"
✅ Admin receives notification to approve the order
✅ Seller sees confirmation message
✅ Products are tracked in the hub system
✅ Seller is redirected back to dashboard

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you see "Order ID not found" error:
- The notification doesn't have a real order linked
- Create a new order by:
  1. Login as a buyer
  2. Add Red Velvet product to cart
  3. Complete checkout
  4. Login back as Micah (seller)
  5. Check notifications - you should see a real order notification

If order details page shows 500 error:
- Check server console logs
- Verify the order exists in database
- Run the diagnostic script again

=====================================
After running the script, you should see output like:
✅ Product sellerId MATCHES Micah's UID
✅ Found order with Red Velvet: ORD-XXXXX
✅ Notification linked to order: [order-id]
✅ All done! Now refresh your seller dashboard to see the notification.
