## 🎬 Live Demonstration (Best Option!)

### If You Can Demo Live to Your Guide:

**Step 1**: Make sure your app is running
```bash
cd client && npm run dev
cd server && npm start
```

**Step 2**: Run tests in front of guide
```bash
cd selenium-tests
run_tests.bat  (or ./run_tests.sh)
```

**Step 3**: While tests run, explain:
- "Watch the browser open automatically"
- "See it fill the registration form"
- "See it login automatically"
- "See it add products to cart"
- "See it add products to wishlist"

**Step 4**: After completion:
- Show the HTML report
- Show the screenshots generated
- Show the console output

**Why this is best**: Guide sees the automation happen in real-time!

## 🎓 Questions Guide Might Ask & Answers

**Q: "How do I know you actually ran these tests?"**  
**A**: "Here's the HTML report with timestamps showing when tests ran. Here are screenshots automatically captured. And I can run them live right now if you'd like."

**Q: "What does this test?"**  
**A**: "It tests 4 critical user journeys: user registration, login, adding products to cart, and adding products to wishlist - all automatically using browser automation."

**Q: "Can you show me the code?"**  
**A**: "Yes, here are the test files. Each test file has clear steps - navigate to page, fill form, submit, verify success. I can walk you through any test."

**Q: "How does it work?"**  
**A**: "Selenium WebDriver controls the browser programmatically. It opens the browser, navigates to pages, fills forms, clicks buttons, and verifies expected results - all automatically."

**Q: "Did you really write this?"**  
**A**: "Yes, I can explain the code structure, the base test class with common methods, the configuration file, and how each test works step by step."

**Q: "Can you run it now?"**  
**A**: "Yes, let me start the app first, then I'll run the test suite. You'll see the browser open and all actions happen automatically."
